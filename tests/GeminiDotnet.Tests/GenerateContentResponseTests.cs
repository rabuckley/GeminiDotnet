AI research and development also involve studying methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use intelligence to achieve specific goals.\n\nHigh-profile applications of AI are common in modern life, including advanced web search engines, recommendation systems (used by platforms like YouTube and Netflix), virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, Alexa), autonomous vehicles, generative tools for language and art, and superhuman performance in strategy games such as chess and Go. Many AI applications are so integrated into daily use that they are no longer explicitly recognized as AI.\n\nThe goals of AI research are broken down into subproblems, including reasoning and problem-solving, knowledge representation, planning and decision-making, learning, natural language processing, perception, and social intelligence. Techniques used to achieve these goals include search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon fields like psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and neuroscience. Some companies, such as OpenAI and Google DeepMind, are working towards artificial general intelligence (AGI), which aims for AI to perform virtually any cognitive task as well as a human.\n\nAI was established as an academic discipline in 1956, experiencing periods of optimism followed by \"AI winters\" where funding and interest declined. A significant resurgence occurred after 2012 with the adoption of graphics processing units (GPUs) for accelerating neural networks and the improved performance of deep learning. The \"AI boom\" in the 2020s, driven by generative AI and transformer architecture, has led to rapid progress but also raised ethical concerns about misinformation, bias, privacy, copyright, environmental impact, and potential existential risks. This has prompted discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of AI technology."
